# clone-of-Nature-s-Basket
<br />
<br />
we were given to clone Nature's Basket website which is one the biggest delivery of grocery products. we cloned this website using react.js . Since we were in early days of our  react learning course , so we faced a lot of difficulty . The most difficult thing was to start the project using react.js, but somehow we started and in next seven days we gave our  best to clone as real as possible
